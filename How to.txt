Folder 'Windows Script'

Powershell script that will allow Windows PC talk to Pi Zero

1. Set the RNDIS Ethernet adapter with an IP of 10.0.0.1, a Subnet Mask of 255.255.255.0, and leave the DNS servers blank.

2. download the script from github here (or copy/paste the whole thing into notepad and name it appropriately),

3. open up an administrative powershell console (ISE or not, it doesn't matter), and navigate to the directory where the script is

4. Run the following command:
-Open Powershell and change directory to PS location.

.\win_connection_share.ps1 -SetPwnagotchiSubnet

--If prompted that running scripts is disabled on your system, run Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned and then re-run the command.

--If prompted that you need to reboot, do so before running the following command. (If not prompted to reboot, proceed.)
.\win_connection_share.ps1 -EnableInternetConnectionSharing

This last command requires you to select which interface is Internet-facing and which is your pwnagotchi. 
After it completes, you should now be able to SSH into your pi @ 10.0.0.2 and from that SSH session ping out to the Internet.
